Immersive VR Campus Experience

Our project aims to create an immersive VR application that allows users to explore the beauty of our college campus. The first phase involved designing prefabs of buildings using Blender, which has been successfully completed.

In the second phase, we are working on combining these prefabs in Unity and adding additional functionalities to enhance the user experience. This includes creating a VR workbench with interactive elements to further immerse users in the virtual campus environment.

Our goal is to provide an engaging and realistic virtual tour of our college campus, showcasing its beauty and facilities to a wider audience.
